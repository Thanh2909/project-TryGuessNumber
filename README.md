# Number Guessing Game

## Introduction
This is a number guessing game where the player will guess a secret number between 1 and 100. The game will analyze and hint if the player guesses higher or lower than the number to be guessed.

## Project Structure
The project is divided into three parts:

1. **library_project**: Contains basic logic functions such as checking correct guesses, generating secret numbers, and calculating the average number of guesses.
2. **data_fetching**: Gathers player information such as name, age, name in game, ...
3. **data_processing**: Runs the number guessing game and processes the results.
